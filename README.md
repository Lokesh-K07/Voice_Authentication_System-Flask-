   </p>

A secure, web-based Voice Authentication System that combines password-based authentication, voice biometrics, and security question verification to provide a robust user authentication mechanism. Users register with their voice samples, answer security questions, and authenticate using voice recognition powered by machine learning. This project was developed as a final-year project to demonstrate advanced concepts in web development, audio processing, and machine learning.

This project implements a voice-based authentication system that integrates speaker recognition, speech content verification, and text-based password validation. It leverages deep learning models for speaker identification and speech classification, with a SQLite database to manage user data, audio samples, and voice embeddings.

 <p align="center">
     <img src="main1.png" alt="main1" height="300" width="500">
   </p>

The Voice Authentication System enhances traditional password-based login systems by incorporating voice biometrics. Users register by providing a user ID, password, and recording voice samples for three security questions. During login, users verify their identity using a password and voice input. A forgot-password feature allows password reset via voice verification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge:** Accurate voice recognition in noisy environments.  
**Solution:** Implemented ambient noise adjustment using SpeechRecognition‚Äôs `adjust_for_ambient_noise` and an energy threshold check (`ENERGY_THRESHOLD = 0.0001`) to filter out silent recordings.

**Challenge:** Handling large audio files and model training.  
**Solution:** Used SpeechBrain‚Äôs pretrained ECAPA-TDNN model to reduce training time and a lightweight CNN for question-specific verification. Audio files are resampled to 16kHz for efficiency.

**Challenge:** Ensuring text and voice answer alignment.  
**Solution:** Integrated Google Speech-to-Text for spoken answer verification and used `SequenceMatcher` for text similarity (threshold ‚â• 0.9).

**Challenge:** Secure storage of sensitive data.  
**Solution:** Stored passwords in plaintext (to be improved with hashing) and excluded `temp/`, `users/`, and `voice_auth.db` from Git using `.gitignore`.

**Challenge:** Model adaptability and up-to-date embeddings.  
**Solution:** The system retrains the custom CNN model and updates the user‚Äôs speaker embeddings each time the user logs in successfully. This helps keep the model in sync with recent voice patterns, improving authentication accuracy over time.
